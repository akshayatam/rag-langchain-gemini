## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains my walkthrough implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain** and **Google Gemini Pro**.  
The project was inspired by an [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/) course, where I followed structured tasks to explore LangChainâ€™s integration with Gemini and experiment with configuration parameters.

Although not a full production project, it showcases how Gemini can be connected with LangChain to create contextual responses, experiment with parameters, and build a simple RAG system on top of PDF data.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Framework:** [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- **LLM:** Google Gemini Pro
- **Libraries:**  
  - `langchain`  
  - `google-generativeai`  
  - `PyPDF2` (for text extraction)  
  - `dotenv` (for managing API keys)

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Building **LLM functionality** with LangChain to generate contextual responses.
- Experimenting with **model parameters** like `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, and `candidate_count`.
- Implementing a **basic RAG pipeline** with PDF ingestion and embedding generation.
- Understanding Geminiâ€™s **chat history and response management**.
